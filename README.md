# Web Technology Lab Exercises

## Lab - 1 (Internet & Basics)
1. Using `nslookup` (or some other mechanism), determine IP addresses for three Internet hosts
    a. `https://www.google.com`
    b. `https://suiit.ac.in`
    c. `http://dheodisha.gov.in`
2. Use the tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Linux) command to determine the number of hops from your machine to the Internet host(s) assigned by your instructor. Each command can be run by typing the command name followed by a host name. (Note: If you attempt to run traceroute on a Linux system and get the message "Command not found", try using the command whereis traceroute to locate it. Then prefix the command name with the directory where it is located.) Provide a copy of the output and briefly explain what it means.
3. Explore the Developer Tools (Chrome) / Web Developer (Firefox)
